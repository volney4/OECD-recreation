# OECD-recreation
This repository holds the STATA code for the recreation of the published paper "The effects of budget deficit on national saving in the OECD" by: Rafael Dome ÃÅnecha, David Taguasb, and Juan Varelac published in 2000.

You will need to download both the csv entitled "national_savings.csv" and the STATA do-file.
